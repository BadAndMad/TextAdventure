The Game got way too big to load it up to moodle(Animations)
You can download it from:
	https://github.com/BadAndMad/TextAdventure
A Text Adventure set in the Land of Varisia
 
This is a little Text Adventure written in Delphi/Lazarus.
It is more a fundation and Groundwork as a full Game, but it can easily turnded into one by adding content (Rooms,Monster,Items,Animations)
This is possible without touching most of the code and there are functions at hand to aid with the development of new rooms.
